{"pageProps":{"data":{"data":{"id":3,"title":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Looks Different For Women","content":"ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all genders, including women. However, ADHD has historically been underdiagnosed in women and girls compared to their male counterparts. This underdiagnosis can be attributed to several factors, including differences in how ADHD symptoms manifest in women and societal biases.\n\nWhile ADHD is commonly associated with hyperactivity and impulsivity, symptoms can vary widely among individuals. In women, ADHD symptoms often present differently and may be less noticeable compared to stereotypical portrayals of the disorder. Some common symptoms and challenges faced by women with ADHD include:\n\n1. Inattention: Women with ADHD may struggle with maintaining focus, staying organized, and completing tasks. They may have difficulty with time management and often find themselves feeling overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities.\n2. Internalized symptoms: Instead of displaying external hyperactivity, women with ADHD may exhibit more internalized symptoms. They may experience racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted. These internal struggles can contribute to feelings of frustration, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\n3. Emotional regulation difficulties: Women with ADHD may struggle with managing their emotions, experiencing heightened sensitivity, mood swings, and impulsivity. These emotional challenges can impact relationships and daily functioning.\n4. Social difficulties: Women with ADHD may face challenges in social settings, often feeling socially isolated or experiencing difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. They may struggle with understanding social cues and maintaining conversations.\n5. Masking or compensatory behaviors: Women with ADHD may develop coping mechanisms to hide their symptoms, such as excessive planning, perfectionism, and people-pleasing. These compensatory behaviors can help them appear more organized and focused but may come at the cost of added stress and anxiety.\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone you know may have ADHD, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or mental health provider. They can evaluate the symptoms, consider the individual's history, and provide a diagnosis or recommend further assessment. ADHD in women can be effectively managed with a combination of interventions, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments. Support groups and educational resources specific to ADHD in women can also be valuable for understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by women with ADHD.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all genders, including women.","date":"2023-03-27","category":"test","slug":"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-looks-different-for-women","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":3,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:52.859Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-20T11:33:40.391Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:54.381Z","image":{"id":5,"name":"blog3_960x600.png","alternativeText":"ADHD in Women","caption":null,"width":960,"height":600,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_blog3_960x600_001551c449.png","hash":"small_blog3_960x600_001551c449","mime":"image/png","name":"small_blog3_960x600.png","path":null,"size":281.84,"width":500,"height":313},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/medium_blog3_960x600_001551c449.png","hash":"medium_blog3_960x600_001551c449","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_blog3_960x600.png","path":null,"size":633.35,"width":750,"height":469},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_blog3_960x600_001551c449.png","hash":"thumbnail_blog3_960x600_001551c449","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_blog3_960x600.png","path":null,"size":73.56,"width":245,"height":153}},"hash":"blog3_960x600_001551c449","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":236.23,"url":"/uploads/blog3_960x600_001551c449.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-20T11:27:27.590Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-20T11:32:47.495Z"}},"meta":{}}},"__N_SSG":true}
