Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Maternal mental health: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can affect a mother's ability to care for her baby, bond with her baby, and navigate the challenges of motherhood. Poor maternal mental health can lead to difficulties with breastfeeding, sleep disturbances, and a lack of interest in engaging with the baby. This can also result in long-term negative effects on the mother's mental health, such as depression and anxiety.\n\n\n3. Child development: The emotional and physical health of the mother is crucial to the baby's development. Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and after birth can negatively impact the baby's brain development and increase the risk of developmental delays and behavioral problems.\n\n\n5. Family dynamics: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can also affect the dynamics of the family as a whole. A mother who is struggling with her mental health may have difficulty engaging with her partner and other family members, which can lead to strain and conflict within the family.\n\n\n7. Stigma and shame: There is still a great deal of stigma and shame associated with perinatal and postnatal mental health issues, which can make it difficult for mothers to seek the help and support they need. This can lead to feelings of isolation and further exacerbate the mother's mental health concerns.\n\n\nOverall, perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it has far-reaching implications for both the mother and the baby's well-being, as well as the dynamics of the family as a whole. It is important to raise awareness about these issues and ensure that mothers have access to the support and resources they need to maintain their mental health during this critical time.\nIf you are struggling with fertility, during pregnancy, or postpartum, we are here for you! \n\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"test","date":"2023-03-12","category":"test","slug":"maternal-mental-health-matters","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":2,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:00.379Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T11:29:50.015Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:03.404Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"coaching610x410.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":610,"height":410,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"small_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"small_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":259.78,"width":500,"height":336},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":65.5,"width":232,"height":156}},"hash":"coaching610x410_b07450d238","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":78.3,"url":"/uploads/coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z"}},{"id":4,"title":"What Does It Mean To Be Inclusive?","content":"To be inclusive means to actively and intentionally create an environment, culture, or society where everyone feels valued, respected, and included, regardless of their differences.

It's important to note that treatment options may vary depending on the severity and individual needs of the person experiencing depression. Here are some common treatment options for depression:\n1. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, involves working with a mental health professional to identify and address the underlying causes of depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are two commonly used types of psychotherapy for depression.\n2. Medication: Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are often prescribed to help manage depression symptoms. It's important to consult with a psychiatrist or healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for an individual's specific needs.\n3. Lifestyle changes: Making positive lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on managing depression. Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding alcohol or drug misuse can help improve mood and overall well-being.\n4. Supportive relationships: Building a strong support system with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and understanding, reducing feelings of isolation and improving mood.\n5. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Practices such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce stress, promote relaxation, and improve emotional well-being.\n6. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): ECT may be recommended for severe depression that has not responded to other treatments. It involves delivering controlled electric currents to the brain under general anesthesia, resulting in a brief seizure. ECT is typically administered in a series of sessions.\n7. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): TMS is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. It is often used when other treatments haven't been effective, and it may be particularly helpful for individuals with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nIt's important for individuals with depression to consult with a mental health professional or healthcare provider to determine the most suitable treatment options based on their specific situation. The effectiveness of treatments can vary from person to person, and a combination of approaches is sometimes used for optimal results.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"test","date":"2023-04-10","category":"test","slug":"treatment-options-for-depression","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":5,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T11:26:25.873Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T11:29:30.168Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T11:29:30.165Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"coaching610x410.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":610,"height":410,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"small_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"small_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":259.78,"width":500,"height":336},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":65.5,"width":232,"height":156}},"hash":"coaching610x410_b07450d238","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":78.3,"url":"/uploads/coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z"}},{"id":3,"title":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Looks Different For Women","content":"ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all genders, including women. However, ADHD has historically been underdiagnosed in women and girls compared to their male counterparts. This underdiagnosis can be attributed to several factors, including differences in how ADHD symptoms manifest in women and societal biases.\n\nWhile ADHD is commonly associated with hyperactivity and impulsivity, symptoms can vary widely among individuals. In women, ADHD symptoms often present differently and may be less noticeable compared to stereotypical portrayals of the disorder. Some common symptoms and challenges faced by women with ADHD include:\n\n1. Inattention: Women with ADHD may struggle with maintaining focus, staying organized, and completing tasks. They may have difficulty with time management and often find themselves feeling overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities.\n2. Internalized symptoms: Instead of displaying external hyperactivity, women with ADHD may exhibit more internalized symptoms. They may experience racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted. These internal struggles can contribute to feelings of frustration, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\n3. Emotional regulation difficulties: Women with ADHD may struggle with managing their emotions, experiencing heightened sensitivity, mood swings, and impulsivity. These emotional challenges can impact relationships and daily functioning.\n4. Social difficulties: Women with ADHD may face challenges in social settings, often feeling socially isolated or experiencing difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. They may struggle with understanding social cues and maintaining conversations.\n5. Masking or compensatory behaviors: Women with ADHD may develop coping mechanisms to hide their symptoms, such as excessive planning, perfectionism, and people-pleasing. These compensatory behaviors can help them appear more organized and focused but may come at the cost of added stress and anxiety.\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone you know may have ADHD, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or mental health provider. They can evaluate the symptoms, consider the individual's history, and provide a diagnosis or recommend further assessment. ADHD in women can be effectively managed with a combination of interventions, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments. Support groups and educational resources specific to ADHD in women can also be valuable for understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by women with ADHD.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"test","date":"2023-03-27","category":"test","slug":"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-looks-different-for-women","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":3,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:52.859Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T11:29:39.435Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T11:22:54.381Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"coaching610x410.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":610,"height":410,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"small_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"small_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":259.78,"width":500,"height":336},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":65.5,"width":232,"height":156}},"hash":"coaching610x410_b07450d238","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":78.3,"url":"/uploads/coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
