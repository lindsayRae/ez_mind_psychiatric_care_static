{"pageProps":{"data":{"data":{"id":11,"title":"Mindfulness and Meditation Make Positive Brain Changes","content":"There is evidence to suggest that mindfulness and meditation can create new neural pathways in the brain. Here's how:\n\n1. Neuroplasticity: Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections in response to experience. Research has shown that mindfulness and meditation can enhance neuroplasticity, which can lead to the formation of new neural pathways in the brain.\n2. Gray matter density: Studies have found that individuals who practice mindfulness and meditation have increased gray matter density in regions of the brain associated with attention, emotion regulation, and sensory processing. This suggests that regular practice of mindfulness and meditation can lead to structural changes in the brain.\n3. Cortical thickness: Mindfulness and meditation have also been shown to increase cortical thickness in areas of the brain associated with attention and sensory processing. This may be due to the increased use of these brain regions during mindfulness and meditation practice.\n4. Default mode network: The default mode network is a network of brain regions that is active when the brain is at rest and not focused on a specific task. Research has found that mindfulness and meditation can reduce activity in the default mode network and increase connectivity between brain regions involved in attention and sensory processing.\n\nOverall, there is growing evidence to suggest that mindfulness and meditation can lead to the creation of new neural pathways in the brain. This can result in improved cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall well-being.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"There is evidence to suggest that mindfulness and meditation can create new neural pathways in the brain.","date":"2023-05-29","category":"test","slug":"mindfulness-and-meditation-make-positive-brain-changes","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":11,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T12:08:12.648Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T12:11:09.516Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T12:08:14.756Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"coaching610x410.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":610,"height":410,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"small_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"small_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":259.78,"width":500,"height":336},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","hash":"thumbnail_coaching610x410_b07450d238","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_coaching610x410.png","path":null,"size":65.5,"width":232,"height":156}},"hash":"coaching610x410_b07450d238","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":78.3,"url":"/uploads/coaching610x410_b07450d238.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:36.227Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-19T12:02:56.654Z"}},"meta":{}}},"__N_SSG":true}
