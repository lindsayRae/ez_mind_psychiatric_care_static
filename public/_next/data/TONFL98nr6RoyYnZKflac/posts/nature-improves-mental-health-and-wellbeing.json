Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Reduces stress: Being in nature and engaging in outdoor activities can help reduce stress and anxiety levels. It has been found that spending time in green spaces can lower cortisol levels, which is the hormone associated with stress.\n\n3. Boosts mood: Exposure to natural light and fresh air can help boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness. Being outside can also help increase our vitamin D levels, which can improve our overall sense of well-being.\n\n\n5. Increases physical activity: Spending time outside can also encourage physical activity, which is known to have numerous mental health benefits. Exercise can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve overall cognitive function.\n\n\n7. Enhances creativity: Being in nature and away from the distractions of modern life can help stimulate our creativity and enhance our ability to problem-solve.\n\n\n9. Provides a sense of connection: Spending time outside can also provide a sense of connection to something larger than ourselves, whether it be the natural world or a community of like-minded individuals.\n\n\nOverall, spending time outside can be an effective way to improve our mental health and well-being. Whether it be a walk in the park, a hike in the woods, or simply sitting outside in the sun, taking time to connect with nature can have a positive impact on our mental health.\n\n\nGet outside today! \n","author":"Kristi Ramirez, PMHNP-BC, FNP-C","description":"Spending time outside can have a significant impact on our mental health and well-being","date":"2023-03-01","category":"test","slug":"nature-improves-mental-health-and-wellbeing","imgURL":null,"articleNumber":1,"createdAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:46.827Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-20T11:28:09.891Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-19T02:35:48.178Z","image":{"id":9,"name":"blog1_960x600.png","alternativeText":"Nature Improves Mental Health","caption":null,"width":960,"height":600,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/small_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a.png","hash":"small_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a","mime":"image/png","name":"small_blog1_960x600.png","path":null,"size":404.22,"width":500,"height":313},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/medium_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a.png","hash":"medium_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_blog1_960x600.png","path":null,"size":912.11,"width":750,"height":469},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a.png","hash":"thumbnail_blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_blog1_960x600.png","path":null,"size":96.43,"width":245,"height":153}},"hash":"blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":515.82,"url":"/uploads/blog1_960x600_4b7b66ea7a.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-20T11:27:28.833Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-20T11:31:59.197Z"}},"meta":{}}},"__N_SSG":true}
