{"pageProps":{"data":{"data":{"id":13,"title":"What Exactly is Bipolar? ","content":"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that alternate between periods of mania and depression. \n\nThere are several types of bipolar disorder, each with its own specific symptoms. The primary types of bipolar disorder are:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder involves experiencing at least one manic episode that lasts for at least seven days or is so severe that immediate hospitalization is required. Depressive episodes may also occur, typically lasting for two weeks or longer.\n**Symptoms of manic episodes:**\n      - Intense euphoria or high energy levels\n      - Decreased need for sleep\n      - Racing thoughts or rapid speech\n      - Increased goal-directed activity or agitation\n      - Impulsivity, recklessness, or engaging in risky behaviors\n      - Grandiose beliefs or inflated self-esteem\n      - Difficulty concentrating or staying focused\n**Symptoms of depressive episodes:**\n      - Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness\n      - Loss of interest or pleasure in activities\n      - Changes in appetite and weight (either loss or gain)\n      - Fatigue or loss of energy\n      - Sleep disturbances (insomnia or excessive sleep)\n      - Feelings of guilt or worthlessness\n      - Difficulty concentrating or making decisions\n      - Thoughts of death or suicide\n2. Bipolar II Disorder: This type involves recurrent depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than full-blown manic episodes.\nSymptoms of hypomanic episodes (similar to manic episodes but less intense):\n- Elevated mood or irritability\n- Increased energy and activity levels\n- Racing thoughts or increased talkativeness\n- Increased self-confidence or grandiosity\n- Decreased need for sleep\n- Engaging in risky behaviors\n3. Cyclothymic Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder is characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and mild depressive symptoms lasting for at least two years (one year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode.\nIt's important to note that the symptoms and severity can vary from person to person, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be made by a mental health professional based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms and medical history. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and promote stability.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"what-exactly-is-bipolar","description":"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that alternate between periods of mania and depression.
