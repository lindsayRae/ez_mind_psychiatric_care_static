{"pageProps":{"data":{"data":{"id":2,"title":"Maternal Mental Health Matters","content":"Perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it can have a significant impact on both the mother and the baby's well-being. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Maternal mental health: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can affect a mother's ability to care for her baby, bond with her baby, and navigate the challenges of motherhood. Poor maternal mental health can lead to difficulties with breastfeeding, sleep disturbances, and a lack of interest in engaging with the baby. This can also result in long-term negative effects on the mother's mental health, such as depression and anxiety.\n2. Child development: The emotional and physical health of the mother is crucial to the baby's development. Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and after birth can negatively impact the baby's brain development and increase the risk of developmental delays and behavioral problems.\n3. Family dynamics: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can also affect the dynamics of the family as a whole. A mother who is struggling with her mental health may have difficulty engaging with her partner and other family members, which can lead to strain and conflict within the family.\n4. Stigma and shame: There is still a great deal of stigma and shame associated with perinatal and postnatal mental health issues, which can make it difficult for mothers to seek the help and support they need. This can lead to feelings of isolation and further exacerbate the mother's mental health concerns.\n\nOverall, perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it has far-reaching implications for both the mother and the baby's well-being, as well as the dynamics of the family as a whole. It is important to raise awareness about these issues and ensure that mothers have access to the support and resources they need to maintain their mental health during this critical time.\nIf you are struggling with fertility, during pregnancy, or postpartum, we are here for you! \n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"maternal-mental-health-matters","description":"Perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it can have a significant impact on both the mother and the baby's well-being.","date":"2023-03-05","category":"Postpartum Depression, Anxiety ","num":2,"createdAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:05.048Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:25.023Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:25.007Z","image":{"id":7,"name":"blog2_960x600.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":960,"height":600,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430004/small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"small_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":335.5,"width":500,"height":313,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430004/medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":736.19,"width":750,"height":469,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430001/thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":85.92,"width":245,"height":153,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}}},"hash":"blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":324.57,"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430002/blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"cloudinary","provider_metadata":{"public_id":"blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"},"createdAt":"2023-06-22T06:33:25.182Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-22T06:33:25.182Z"}},"meta":{}}},"__N_SSG":true}
