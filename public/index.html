    I have experience in many areas of nursing. I started my career working as a psychiatric nurse and in intensive care units. That has served a tremendous value as I have continued on my journey in health care. I obtained my graduate degree in nursing and became board certified in Family practice in 2012. I worked in many settings including internal medicine, short term and long term care facilities, family practice working with underserved population, urgent care, and pediatrics. After serving in these areas I noticed they all had something in common, untreated mental health conditions and a shortage of providers to see my patients. I wanted to provide better care and saw an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and growth. I began my training in psychiatry in 2017 and became board certified in Psychiatric Mental Health in 2020. I bring a unique stance in caring for you as I have great knowledge of both physical and mental health and how these often are intertwined. It is important to get to a place of feeling mentally and physically well and I am here to help you on your journey to optimize both.

It has been found that spending time in green spaces can lower cortisol levels, which is the hormone associated with stress.\n2. Boosts mood: Exposure to natural light and fresh air can help boost our mood and increase feelings of happiness. Being outside can also help increase our vitamin D levels, which can improve our overall sense of well-being.\n3. Increases physical activity: Spending time outside can also encourage physical activity, which is known to have numerous mental health benefits. Exercise can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improve overall cognitive function.\n4. Enhances creativity: Being in nature and away from the distractions of modern life can help stimulate our creativity and enhance our ability to problem-solve.\n5. Provides a sense of connection: Spending time outside can also provide a sense of connection to something larger than ourselves, whether it be the natural world or a community of like-minded individuals.\nOverall, spending time outside can be an effective way to improve our mental health and well-being. Whether it be a walk in the park, a hike in the woods, or simply sitting outside in the sun, taking time to connect with nature can have a positive impact on our mental health.\nGet outside today! \n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"nature-improves-mental-health-and-wellbeing","description":"Spending time outside can have a significant impact on our mental health and well-being.

Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Maternal mental health: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can affect a mother's ability to care for her baby, bond with her baby, and navigate the challenges of motherhood. Poor maternal mental health can lead to difficulties with breastfeeding, sleep disturbances, and a lack of interest in engaging with the baby. This can also result in long-term negative effects on the mother's mental health, such as depression and anxiety.\n2. Child development: The emotional and physical health of the mother is crucial to the baby's development. Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and after birth can negatively impact the baby's brain development and increase the risk of developmental delays and behavioral problems.\n3. Family dynamics: Perinatal and postnatal mental health can also affect the dynamics of the family as a whole. A mother who is struggling with her mental health may have difficulty engaging with her partner and other family members, which can lead to strain and conflict within the family.\n4. Stigma and shame: There is still a great deal of stigma and shame associated with perinatal and postnatal mental health issues, which can make it difficult for mothers to seek the help and support they need. This can lead to feelings of isolation and further exacerbate the mother's mental health concerns.\n\nOverall, perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it has far-reaching implications for both the mother and the baby's well-being, as well as the dynamics of the family as a whole. It is important to raise awareness about these issues and ensure that mothers have access to the support and resources they need to maintain their mental health during this critical time.\nIf you are struggling with fertility, during pregnancy, or postpartum, we are here for you! \n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"maternal-mental-health-matters","description":"Perinatal and postnatal mental health is important because it can have a significant impact on both the mother and the baby's well-being.","date":"2023-03-05","category":"Postpartum Depression, Anxiety ","num":2,"createdAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:05.048Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:25.023Z","publishedAt":"2023-06-22T12:26:25.007Z","image":{"id":7,"name":"blog2_960x600.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":960,"height":600,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430004/small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"small_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":335.5,"width":500,"height":313,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"small_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430004/medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":736.19,"width":750,"height":469,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"medium_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430001/thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","hash":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600.png","path":null,"size":85.92,"width":245,"height":153,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"thumbnail_blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"}}},"hash":"blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":324.57,"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dsrth1qkv/image/upload/v1687430002/blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"cloudinary","provider_metadata":{"public_id":"blog2_960x600_6aad8c5e82","resource_type":"image"},"createdAt":"2023-06-22T06:33:25.182Z","updatedAt":"2023-06-22T06:33:25.182Z"}},{"id":3,"title":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Looks Different For Women","content":"ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all genders, including women. However, ADHD has historically been underdiagnosed in women and girls compared to their male counterparts. This underdiagnosis can be attributed to several factors, including differences in how ADHD symptoms manifest in women and societal biases.\n\nWhile ADHD is commonly associated with hyperactivity and impulsivity, symptoms can vary widely among individuals. In women, ADHD symptoms often present differently and may be less noticeable compared to stereotypical portrayals of the disorder. Some common symptoms and challenges faced by women with ADHD include:\n\n1. Inattention: Women with ADHD may struggle with maintaining focus, staying organized, and completing tasks. They may have difficulty with time management and often find themselves feeling overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities.\n2. Internalized symptoms: Instead of displaying external hyperactivity, women with ADHD may exhibit more internalized symptoms. They may experience racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted. These internal struggles can contribute to feelings of frustration, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\n3. Emotional regulation difficulties: Women with ADHD may struggle with managing their emotions, experiencing heightened sensitivity, mood swings, and impulsivity. These emotional challenges can impact relationships and daily functioning.\n4. Social difficulties: Women with ADHD may face challenges in social settings, often feeling socially isolated or experiencing difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. They may struggle with understanding social cues and maintaining conversations.\n5. Masking or compensatory behaviors: Women with ADHD may develop coping mechanisms to hide their symptoms, such as excessive planning, perfectionism, and people-pleasing. These compensatory behaviors can help them appear more organized and focused but may come at the cost of added stress and anxiety.\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone you know may have ADHD, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or mental health provider. They can evaluate the symptoms, consider the individual's history, and provide a diagnosis or recommend further assessment. ADHD in women can be effectively managed with a combination of interventions, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle adjustments. Support groups and educational resources specific to ADHD in women can also be valuable for understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by women with ADHD.\n\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-looks-different-for-women","description":"ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals of all genders, including women.

It's important to note that treatment options may vary depending on the severity and individual needs of the person experiencing depression. Here are some common treatment options for depression:\n\n1. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, involves working with a mental health professional to identify and address the underlying causes of depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are two commonly used types of psychotherapy for depression.\n2. Medication: Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are often prescribed to help manage depression symptoms. It's important to consult with a psychiatrist or healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for an individual's specific needs.\n3. Lifestyle changes: Making positive lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on managing depression. Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding alcohol or drug misuse can help improve mood and overall well-being.\n4. Supportive relationships: Building a strong support system with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and understanding, reducing feelings of isolation and improving mood.\n5. Mindfulness and relaxation techniques: Practices such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce stress, promote relaxation, and improve emotional well-being.\n6. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): ECT may be recommended for severe depression that has not responded to other treatments. It involves delivering controlled electric currents to the brain under general anesthesia, resulting in a brief seizure. ECT is typically administered in a series of sessions.\n7. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): TMS is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. It is often used when other treatments haven't been effective, and it may be particularly helpful for individuals with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nIt's important for individuals with depression to consult with a mental health professional or healthcare provider to determine the most suitable treatment options based on their specific situation.

Here are some key reasons why it is crucial:\n\n1. Improved Quality of Life: Treating mental health conditions can significantly enhance a person's overall quality of life. Mental health disorders can cause distress, impair daily functioning, and hinder personal relationships. By seeking and receiving appropriate treatment, individuals can experience relief from symptoms, regain control over their lives, and engage more fully in activities they enjoy.\n2. Physical Health Benefits: Mental health and physical health are closely interconnected. Untreated mental health conditions can lead to various physical health problems, including cardiovascular issues, weakened immune system, chronic pain, and increased risk of developing certain illnesses. By addressing mental health concerns, individuals can promote their overall well-being and reduce the risk of associated physical health complications.\n3. Productivity and Functioning: Mental health conditions can significantly impact a person's ability to perform well at work or school. Untreated conditions such as depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can lead to decreased concentration, impaired decision-making, decreased productivity, and absenteeism. Treating these conditions can help individuals regain their focus, improve cognitive abilities, and enhance overall functioning in various domains of life.\n4. Prevention of Escalation: Mental health conditions, if left untreated, can worsen over time. Early intervention and treatment can prevent the progression of symptoms and mitigate the risk of complications. Prompt treatment can help manage symptoms effectively, prevent crises or relapses, and minimize the likelihood of requiring more intensive interventions in the future.\n5. Impact on Relationships: Mental health conditions can strain relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners. Symptoms like irritability, mood swings, social withdrawal, or communication difficulties can create tension and misunderstanding. By seeking treatment, individuals can better understand their condition, develop coping strategies, and engage in healthier communication and relationship-building, improving their overall social well-being.\n6. Reduction of Stigma: Treating mental health conditions helps combat the stigma surrounding mental health. When people seek treatment and share their experiences openly, it fosters a more compassionate and understanding society. It encourages others to seek help, promotes acceptance, and creates an environment where individuals feel supported and empowered to prioritize their mental health.\n7. Suicide Prevention: Mental health conditions, particularly depression and certain anxiety disorders, can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Timely and appropriate treatment can be life-saving for individuals experiencing such distress. By addressing mental health concerns, we can provide the necessary support and interventions to prevent tragic outcomes.\n\nIn summary, treating mental health conditions is crucial for improving quality of life, promoting physical health, enhancing productivity, preventing escalation, nurturing relationships, reducing stigma, and preventing tragic consequences. It is essential to prioritize mental health and ensure that individuals have access to appropriate and effective treatment options.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"why-seek-help","description":"Treating mental health conditions is of paramount importance for several reasons.

Here are several reasons why vitamin D is important for mental health:\n\n1. Regulation of neurotransmitters: Vitamin D helps regulate the production and release of neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are crucial for mood regulation, and imbalances can contribute to conditions such as depression and anxiety.\n2. Anti-inflammatory effects: Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties, and chronic inflammation has been linked to various mental health disorders, including depression. By reducing inflammation, vitamin D may help improve mood and protect against certain mental health conditions.\n3. Brain development and function: Vitamin D receptors are present throughout the brain, including areas associated with mood and cognition. Sufficient levels of vitamin D are important for optimal brain development and function, which can have a positive impact on mental health.\n4. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Seasonal changes, particularly reduced sunlight exposure during winter months, can lead to a condition known as Seasonal Affective Disorder. It is characterized by depressive symptoms that occur in a seasonal pattern. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to alleviate symptoms of SAD, likely due to its role in regulating mood.\n5. Cognitive function and memory: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with impaired cognitive function and an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. By supporting cognitive processes, vitamin D may indirectly contribute to mental health by maintaining optimal brain function.\n6. Sleep regulation: Adequate vitamin D levels are believed to support healthy sleep patterns. Disrupted sleep is closely linked to mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.

Traumatic experiences can vary widely, including but not limited to natural disasters, accidents, violence, abuse, loss, or witnessing traumatic events.\n\nThe impact of trauma can be profound and can affect various aspects of an individual's life. Here are some common effects of trauma:\n\n1. Emotional and Psychological Impact: Trauma can lead to a range of emotional and psychological difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts. Individuals may also experience mood swings, irritability, and a sense of emotional numbness.\n2. Physical Impact: Trauma can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches, chronic pain, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. These physical symptoms can be a result of the body's stress response being activated for prolonged periods.\n3. Cognitive Impact: Trauma can affect cognitive functions, including memory, concentration, and decision-making abilities. Individuals may have difficulties with focus, attention, and processing new information.\n4. Interpersonal Difficulties: Trauma can impact an individual's relationships with others. It may lead to social withdrawal, isolation, distrust, and difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy connections. Trauma can also affect intimacy and sexual functioning.\n5. Self-esteem and Identity Issues: Traumatic experiences can disrupt an individual's sense of self and lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and self-blame. This can contribute to a diminished sense of self-worth and confidence.\n6. Coping and Behavioral Patterns: Trauma can influence an individual's coping mechanisms and behaviors. Some individuals may engage in avoidant behaviors, while others may resort to unhealthy coping strategies like substance abuse, self-harm, or disordered eating.\n\nIt is important to note that individuals may respond to trauma in different ways, and not everyone will experience the same set of effects. The impact of trauma can be long-lasting, but with appropriate support, treatment of co-existing mental health conditions, therapy, and self-care, individuals can work towards healing and regaining a sense of well-being. \n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"the-impact-of-trauma","description":"Trauma refers to an emotional response that arises from an overwhelmingly distressing event or series of events.

The primary types of bipolar disorder are:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder involves experiencing at least one manic episode that lasts for at least seven days or is so severe that immediate hospitalization is required. Depressive episodes may also occur, typically lasting for two weeks or longer.\n**Symptoms of manic episodes:**\n      - Intense euphoria or high energy levels\n      - Decreased need for sleep\n      - Racing thoughts or rapid speech\n      - Increased goal-directed activity or agitation\n      - Impulsivity, recklessness, or engaging in risky behaviors\n      - Grandiose beliefs or inflated self-esteem\n      - Difficulty concentrating or staying focused\n**Symptoms of depressive episodes:**\n      - Persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness\n      - Loss of interest or pleasure in activities\n      - Changes in appetite and weight (either loss or gain)\n      - Fatigue or loss of energy\n      - Sleep disturbances (insomnia or excessive sleep)\n      - Feelings of guilt or worthlessness\n      - Difficulty concentrating or making decisions\n      - Thoughts of death or suicide\n2. Bipolar II Disorder: This type involves recurrent depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than full-blown manic episodes.\nSymptoms of hypomanic episodes (similar to manic episodes but less intense):\n- Elevated mood or irritability\n- Increased energy and activity levels\n- Racing thoughts or increased talkativeness\n- Increased self-confidence or grandiosity\n- Decreased need for sleep\n- Engaging in risky behaviors\n3. Cyclothymic Disorder: This type of bipolar disorder is characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and mild depressive symptoms lasting for at least two years (one year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode.\nIt's important to note that the symptoms and severity can vary from person to person, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder should be made by a mental health professional based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms and medical history. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and promote stability.\n","author":"Kristi Ramirez","slug":"what-exactly-is-bipolar","description":"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that alternate between periods of mania and depression.
